# CUI Shortcut

The CUI Shortcut project demonstrates how to add a keyboard shortcut to Aras Innovator.

## History

This project and the following release notes have been migrated from the old Aras Projects page.

Release | Notes
--------|--------
[v2.1](https://github.com/ArasLabs/cui-shortcut/releases/tag/v2.1) | Bug fixes
[v2.0](https://github.com/ArasLabs/cui-shortcut/releases/tag/v2.0) | Added new keyboard shortcuts
[v1](https://github.com/ArasLabs/cui-shortcut/releases/tag/v1) | Initial Release *

> \* The original shortcut this project demonstrated used Ctrl+A to select all items in a grid. This was added to standard product around 11.0 SP12, so it is not recommended that you use v1.
